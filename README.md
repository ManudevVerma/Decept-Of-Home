Hello, Welcome to mtm home automations project repositary. This is a project made by our team "Roboduino 4" in the event of BotRush of Robotics Club. We secured 1st position in it. 
The technologies we have used to create this project includes the use of microcontrollers like Arduino and Wifi module lie ESP32 Modules for wireless connection between arduino and internet.
We have also used IFTTT Protocols, BlynK IoT, Arduino IoT, Google voice commands in out home, along with high tech sesors like humidity and gas + smoke detection sensors, water level sensors.
It is equipped with 2 Arduino UNO Modules along with 1 ESP32 module for controlling various functions like Light turning on/off using voice commands via google assistant, turning fan speed up or down using IoT, etc.
